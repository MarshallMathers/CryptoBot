# The Neuros Trader

## Overview
   The goal of this project is to compare the differences between how effective a Machine learning based approach performs versus how a traditional financial analysis approach performs. By selecting two different Machine Learning based algorithms, we can better illustrate the associated strengths and weaknesses that each analysis carries. Since our outcome is unknown we arenâ€™t basing our success on which algorithm performs the best but rather to exemplify how effective each approach is at identifying trends on historical data.

### Core Branches and their contents
Core Branches  | Description
------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------
SVM | SVM data that inlcudes modified files from the datascraper as well as the SVM code itself
NN | Neural Net branch that contains the LSTM and data parser
TrakerMK1 | The trader branch which contains the Technical Analysis portion of this project

### Depricated and unused branches
Legacy Braches | Description
------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------
qLearn | This branch was our exploration into Qlearning/Reinforcement Learning using GYM. We ended up abandoning this as it was far too resource and time intensive 
datascraper | Served as the testing grounds to build out our data scraper and parser for gathering bitcoin data from the web
sortingfun | This branch was created during the infancy of our project, files were then cloned and modified on our datascraper branch

#### Notes
This repo is not entirely up to date as the final stage of our project is sitting on our school's servers and needs to be retrieved to update this repository. This will happen between the dates of **September 21st - 23rd**
