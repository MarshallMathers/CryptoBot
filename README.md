# The Neuros Trader

## Overview
   The goal of this project is to compare the differences between how effective a Machine learning based approach performs versus how a traditional financial analysis approach performs. By selecting two different Machine Learning based algorithms, we can better illustrate the associated strengths and weaknesses that each analysis carries. Since our outcome is unknown we arenâ€™t basing our success on which algorithm performs the best but rather to exemplify how effective each approach is at identifying trends on historical data.
